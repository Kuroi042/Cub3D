Project Description:

Title: 3D Raycasting Engine in C

This project implements a basic 3D raycasting engine in C, inspired by classic first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D. Raycasting is a technique used to render a 3D scene by projecting rays from the player's viewpoint and calculating the intersections with walls in the scene.

Key Features:

Raycasting Engine: Utilizes raycasting to render a 3D environment, providing a basic yet functional representation of walls and objects.
MiniMap: Includes a minimap feature that displays an overhead view of the game world, aiding in navigation and providing a bird's-eye perspective of the player's surroundings.
Texture Mapping: Implements texture mapping to add detail to the walls, enhancing the visual appeal of the rendered scene.
Simple Controls: Offers simple keyboard controls for navigating through the 3D environment, allowing users to move forward, backward, and turn left or right.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the C source code using a compatible compiler.
Run the executable file to launch the 3D raycasting engine.
Use the keyboard controls to move around and explore the environment.
Enjoy the retro-style 3D rendering experience!
