## _3D Raycasting Engine in C_



_This project implements a basic 3D raycasting engine in C, inspired by classic first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D. Raycasting is a technique used to render a 3D scene by projecting rays from the player's viewpoint and calculating the intersections with walls in the scene_

## Key Features

- Raycasting Engine: Utilizes raycasting to render a 3D environment, providing a basic yet functional representation of walls and objects.

- MiniMap: Includes a minimap feature that displays an overhead view of the game world.

- Texture Mapping: Implements texture mapping to add detail to the walls, enhancing the visual appeal of the rendered scene.
- Simple Controls: Offers simple keyboard controls for navigating through the 3D environment, allowing users to move forward, backward, and turn left or right.

## How to Use


-Clone the repository to your local machine.

-Add MLX library files to the repository.

-Compile the C source code using a compatible compiler.

-Run the executable file to launch the 3D raycasting engine.

-Use the keyboard controls to move around and explore the environment.

-Enjoy the retro-style 3D rendering experience!
